This code was used to produce the results of the article 
"Global Catastrophic Effects on Future Climate due to Increasing Total Solar Irradiance. A General Atmospheric Circulation Analysis."
which is beeing submitted.

This directory contains four MATLAB scripts that organize and calculate the seazonal zonal means for ERA-Interim (erainterim.m), Reanalysis 2 (reanalysis2.m), two 10-year CESM runs (simulations_10yr.m) and the script that creates the graphics (graphics.m).

The input data for the erainterim.m can be downloaded at https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds627.1/
The input data for the reanalysis2.m can be downloaded at http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis2.html
The input data for the simulations_10yr.m are openly provided by the authors at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1133966
